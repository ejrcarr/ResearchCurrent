# An Invariant of Virtual Trivalent Spatial Graphs

## Introduction
This Python program generates various types of mathematical structures, including exhaustively computed configurations of 
Latin Squares, Latin Cubes, Tribrackets, and partial Latin Squares of dimensions 3x3 and 4x4. The program also includes calculations for unique 
3x3 Niebrzydowski algebra and 3x3 virtual Niebrzydowski algebra, and computations for all distinct partially defined virtual tribrackets and 
Niebrzydowski algebras of size 3.
